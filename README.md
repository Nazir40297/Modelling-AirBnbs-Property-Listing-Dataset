## Description

This project involves training and evaluating various machine learning models for predicting Airbnb nightly prices. It covers both regression and classification tasks, aiming to achieve accurate predictions and understand feature importance.

The project involves the following key steps:

- Data loading and preprocessing using `load_airbnb` function.
- Data splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
- Training and tuning various regression and classification models.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE, R^2, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Neural network training and evaluation using PyTorch.

Through this project, we aim to gain insights into selecting and tuning machine learning models effectively for predicting Airbnb nightly prices.

## Installation

Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages using the 'environment.yml' file. Create and activate the environment.
Download and load the dataset using the 'load_airbnb' function in the 'tabular_data.py' file.

## Usage

Modify the dataset loading process in the code as needed.
Run the provided code in the appropriate sections to evaluate regression and classification models as well as neural networks.
Modify the hyperparameter search spaces and other configurations as per your experiment requirements.
